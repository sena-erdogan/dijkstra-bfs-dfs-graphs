# dijkstra-bfs-dfs-graphs

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in the book is generalized to:
- Run efficiently for both ListGraph and MatrixGraph representations of the graph.
- If the edges of a graph carry several properties, the program should run for any specified property of the edges.
- Addition operator is replaced with any associative operator such as addition, multiplication, or ∗ (𝑎 ∗ 𝑏 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑎𝑏) operator. Note that

Two methods are implemented to find the number of connected components in a graph: one using BFS and the other using DFS.

A method that calculates the normalized importance values defined above for each vertex in a graph 𝐺. 
Let 𝐺(𝑉, 𝐸) be an undirected and unweighted graph. The importance of a vertex 𝑣 in 𝑉 can be calculated using the following formula
